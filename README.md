# Introduction:
## Project Name: Yield Yak
- Use Case: Yield Yak builds DeFi tools for users on Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Mantle.  Most notably Yak Swap, a zero-fee 100% onchain DEX aggregator, and its yield products, which auto-compound and boost yield for users. 
# Purpose of Distribution:
## Distribution Plan
- 10% to developers, per LayerZero request
- 90% to the YAK community, with the following boosts to users shared applied to individual holders in order to weight rewards to LayerZero users
  - 2x Boost to allocation share to users who bridged the YAK OFT prior to Snapshot #1
  - 2x Boost to allocation share to users who voted on Yield Yak LayerZero Governance Proposals which selected LayerZero as OFT provider. 
  - A 0.1 YAK minimum criteria is needed to be eligible for above allocation. 
  - All Treasury and Team wallets have been removed from the allocation to ensure the 90% distribution targets only community members
# Justification:
We are respecting the preference of LayerZero for 10% of allocation to go to developers.  For the remaining 90%, we wish to reward all YAK holders but with a significant weight towards ones who used LayerZero technology (2x boost to users who bridged the YAK OFT) as well as users who participated in the decision to choose LayerZero as YAK’s omni-chain solution (2x boost to governance voters).  In this way we believe the allocation will go towards not only a strong and loyal group of DeFi users, but ones who have been part of LayerZero’s growth till now.
